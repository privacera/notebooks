        "1.  Sign up for a free account at [Privacera AI Governance (PAIG)](https://privacera.ai). This is simple, all you need is your email address.\n",

        "3. Generates sample documents and associates the access permissions and classifications for these documents.\n",
        "4. Using LangChain, embeddings are created and stored in VectorDB along with access control permissions and classifications from the original documents.\n",
        "4. Sets up the GenAI application and VectorDB in the PAIG portal.\n",
        "5. Writes a GenAI application using LangChain, which uses Milvus as VectorDB and PAIG for Safety, Security, and Observability.\n",
        "6. Tries out various use cases to ensure that data leakage doesn't happen.\n"
