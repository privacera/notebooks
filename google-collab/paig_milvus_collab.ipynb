        "4. Using LangChain, embeddings are created and stored in VectorDB along with access control permissions and classifications from the original documents.\n",
        "4. Sets up the GenAI application and VectorDB in the PAIG portal.\n",
        "5. Writes a GenAI application using LangChain, which uses Milvus as VectorDB and PAIG for Safety, Security, and Observability.\n",
        "6. Tries out various use cases to ensure that data leakage doesn't happen.\n"
